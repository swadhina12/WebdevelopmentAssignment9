### Q.1 What are hooks in react? how to identify hooks?
Ans:In React, hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced in React version 16.8 as a way to write reusable and stateful logic without using class components.

Hooks provide a way to "hook into" React's lifecycle and state management capabilities. They allow you to add features such as state, side effects, and context to your functional components.

There are several built-in hooks in React, including:

1-useState: This hook enables you to add state to your functional components. It returns a stateful value and a function to update that value.

2-useEffect: This hook allows you to perform side effects in your components. It runs after the component has rendered and can be used for tasks like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually modifying the DOM.

3-useContext: This hook enables you to access the value of a React context within a functional component.

4-useRef: This hook returns a mutable ref object that persists across component renders. It can be used to access DOM elements or to hold mutable values.

5-useMemo: This hook memoizes the result of a function and only recomputes it if the dependencies have changed. It can be useful for optimizing expensive calculations.

6-useCallback: This hook returns a memoized version of a callback function. It is useful for preventing unnecessary re-renders in child components.

Hooks can be identified by their naming convention. All hooks start with the prefix "use," such as useState, useEffect, useContext, etc. This naming convention helps React recognize and manage the state and lifecycle of the components that use these hooks.

Additionally, React enforces certain rules for using hooks. Hooks can only be called at the top level of a functional component or within other custom hooks, not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. This ensures that hooks are called consistently and in the same order on every render.
