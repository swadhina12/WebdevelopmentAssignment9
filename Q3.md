### Q.3 How to pass data from one component to another component?
Ans:In React, there are several ways to pass data from one component to another. The method you choose depends on the relationship between the components and the direction of data flow. Here are a few commonly used approaches:

Props (Properties): The most common way to pass data between components is through props. You can pass data from a parent component to its child component by assigning values to props when rendering the child component. The child component can then access and use the passed data through its props.
Example:

```JavaScript
// ParentComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

function ParentComponent() {
  const data = 'Hello from parent';

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent data={data} />
    </div>
  );
}

// ChildComponent.js
import React from 'react';

function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <div>{props.data}</div>;
}
```

Context API: React's Context API allows you to create a context and share data across multiple components, regardless of their parent-child relationship. It provides a way to pass data through the component tree without explicitly passing it down through each intermediate component.
Example:

```JavaScript
// DataContext.js
import React from 'react';

const DataContext = React.createContext();

export default DataContext;

// ParentComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import DataContext from './DataContext';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

function ParentComponent() {
  const data = 'Hello from parent';

  return (
    <DataContext.Provider value={data}>
      <ChildComponent />
    </DataContext.Provider>
  );
}

// ChildComponent.js
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import DataContext from './DataContext';

function ChildComponent() {
  const data = useContext(DataContext);

  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

1-State Management Libraries: When dealing with complex data sharing and state management across multiple components, you can use state management libraries like Redux or MobX. These libraries provide a centralized state management solution that can be accessed by any component in your application.

2-URL Parameters: If you need to pass data between components as part of the URL, you can use URL parameters. Libraries like React Router allow you to define dynamic routes with placeholders, and you can access the passed parameters in the target component.

These are just a few approaches to pass data between components in React. The choice of method depends on the specific requirements of your application and the complexity of data sharing needed.
