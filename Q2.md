### Q.2 Explain useState Hook & what can you achieve with it?
Ans:The useState hook is one of the built-in hooks in React that allows you to add state to functional components. It provides a way to declare and manage state variables within a functional component, similar to how the "this.state" works in class components.

To use the useState hook, you need to import it from the 'react' package:

```JavaScript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```

The useState hook takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that value. The initial value can be a primitive (like a string or number) or an object.

Here's an example of using useState to manage a counter in a functional component:

```JavaScript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
In this example, we declare a state variable called "count" using the useState hook. The "count" variable holds the current value of the counter, and the "setCount" function is used to update it.

By calling the "setCount" function with a new value, React re-renders the component, updating the value of "count" and reflecting the changes in the UI.

The useState hook allows you to achieve the following with functional components:

1-State Management: useState enables you to manage and update state within a functional component, eliminating the need for class components.

2-Multiple State Variables: You can use useState multiple times in a single component to manage multiple independent state variables.

3-Functional Updates: The state update function returned by useState allows you to update the state based on its previous value. This is particularly useful when the new state depends on the previous state.

4-Re-rendering: When the state changes using the useState hook, React will re-render the component and update the UI to reflect the new state value.

Using the useState hook, functional components can now have local state and be more powerful and flexible in managing dynamic data and user interactions.
